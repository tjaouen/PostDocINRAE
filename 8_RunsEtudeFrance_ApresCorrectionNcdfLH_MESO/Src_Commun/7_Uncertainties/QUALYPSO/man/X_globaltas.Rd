\description{
Annual warming levels at the planetary scales simulated by different CMIP5
GCMs for the period 1971-2099. Warming levels are obtained with respect to
the year 1860 (common starting year of the CMIP5 simulations). These warming
levels have been obtained with the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Annual tas averages simulated by different CMIP5 have first been smoothed
using a smoothing spline. Let us denote these smoothed values by
tas_GCM(y) for a year y.
\item Large discrepancies can be observed for tas_GCM_smooth(y) even in the past
due to large first-order biases in the GCM simulations. In order to obtain a
common reference, we also consider observed tas estimates at the global scale.
HadCRUT5 (Morice et al., 2021, 10.1029/2019JD032361) provides anomalies with
respect to the period 1961-1990. An estimate of absolute average temperature
for this period is 14Â°C (Jones et al., 1999, 10.1029/1999RG900002). Smoothed
estimates of absolute tas averages are obtained using a smoothing spline and
is denoted by tas_obs(y).
\item Warming levels are obtained as anomalies with respect to the period 1860
and considering a reference year, here 1990, where the warming levels WL are
in agreement:
WL(y) = tas_GCM(y)-tas_GCM(1990)+tas_obs(1990)-tas_obs(1860)
